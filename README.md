## Credit
FlatButton was originally published by Katsuma Tanaka, and later bound to work with Xamarin.iOS by Pierce Boggan.

Please thank him for his hard work in creating the control, as well as the demo, as the Xamarin.iOS version is pretty much just a bound version of his work.

## Installation
For a completely fresh install, build the static library, followed by the binding project. Reference the .dll generated by the binding project in a project you wish to use it
